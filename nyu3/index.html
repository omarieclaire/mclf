        <h1>Leaving The Game Center: <br><span class="subtitle">Closing thoughts</span></h1>

        <p>I’m looking back at my experience as the artist-in-residence at the NYU Game Center. It seems incredible, especially now, that this ever happened. Looking back, I understand my experience as <span class="highlightme">a braid of
            shaping practice, producing work, and relation.</span></p>

<hr>

        <p>I started this post months ago. But then COVID-19 happened, and it seemed strange to share these thoughts while everyone was huddling at home in distress.</p>

        <p>Things aren't really better now, but we're used to it. I guess that's the way this works. We get used to almost anything.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/eg-germs.png" alt="drawing of a mask, hand sanitizer, soap, and germs" class="image">


        <h2>Product & Process</h2>

        <p>I’m resisting the pressure to reduce my reflections into a list of achievements and products. I'm resisting the quiet pressure from (imaginary) funders, employers, and peers to only notice and value things that are easy to
          measure.</p>
        <p>There's a constant whispering that if only we push ourselves to the front, present the work with enough hyperbole, and shake the right hands while
          saying the right words we'll find a way to be seen, to find our place in things, and to thrive.</p>
        <p>Instead, I'm trying to hold <span class="highlightme"> being-in-practice</span> and <span class="highlightme">being-in-relation</span> at the front. They don't have the howling glamour of achievements. But they are the foundation
          of
          everything.</p>



        <h2>What I did as Artist in Residence</h2>

        <p>The work I did was a braid of shaping practice, relations with the people/ecosystem around me, and producing work. Like a braid, these aren't separate items, they come from the same place and are inextricable from each other. </p>

        <h3>Practice - forming context:</h3>

          <li>Failing and fumbling, tuning ideas</li>
          <li>Fiddling with materials - wood, garbage, TAP plastics (thinking about plastic), old arcade cabinets, old curtains, fabric, metal, solder, electronic components, food, paper, more garbage</li>

        <h2>Being a resident</h2>

        <p>Having a paid artist residency in a space with incredible people is a major gift. It's also a strange space to occupy. <a target="_blank" href="https://marieflanagan.com/nyu1/"> I wrote about this earlier.</a></p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The residency had three parts</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Part 1 (Aug - Oct):</strong> Relocating to New York City and producing a work. An intense 8-week hustle to design and code a brand new game for No Quarter. Simultaneously navigating major personal life changes. <a target="_blank" href="https://marieflanagan.com/nyu2/"> I wrote about it here.</a></li>
          <li><strong>Part 2 (Oct - Nov):</strong> Working on my NYU Game Center talk. Dealing with emergency housing instability. Physically recovering from Part 1.</li>
          <li><strong>Part 3 (Nov - Dec ):</strong> A life-changing magical free time of collaboration, shaping work, and thriving. Something I will delightedly carry with me for the rest of my life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning about formal games</h2>
        <p>During the residency, I learned a lot about games. While studying the formal structure of traditional games I finally clarified some of the things I love about play, and also what I don’t like about games.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-play.png" alt="drawing of a happy person" class="wide-image">

        <p>One small example: It is strange to me that we (game designers) so often use <span class="highlightme">emotional manipulation to generate intense scarcity-based fear. Or that we push players to embody stress-motivated competitive behaviours</span>. As a player, this is not fun for me and I’m totally
          bewildered that this is fun for anyone.</p>


          <!-- Creating false scarcity to encourage stress-motivated competition seems to be part of -->

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-loud.png" alt="drawing of an overwhelmed person" class="wide-image">


        <p>Sometimes I think this is just a matter of volume. Like I might like this as much as anyone, but the volume is just too loud.</p>



        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Relationships and community take time, and I didn't have time. I had to rally all my courage and be vulnerable, inviting myself into people's busy lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Time:</strong> I felt like each minute was full of possibility and the weather was always perfect and the work was always waiting and the time kept shrinking.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking for help:</strong> I found it very challenging to even find the right person to ask for help (code, design, moving, everything!) let alone know what to ask or how to ask.</li>
          <li><strong>Health:</strong> Some major health challenges including an injury that left me laying on the floor of my office with heat pads.</li>
          <li><strong>Money:</strong> This was a well-paying job. But New York is expensive. And unexpected housing precarity in combination with health-related housing needs made the situation worse. Canada Council rejected my application for this residency (no
            feedback). Any *why* is possible, without feedback it's a gaping hole of possibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Housing/Safety:</strong> I had more than one incident where my housing felt unsafe and precarious. This got expensive, overwhelming, and generally awful. Thankfully P & T rescued me from the worst of it. </li>
        </ul>


        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-home.png" alt="sad house" class="image">


        <h2>Regrets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I regret not starting the No Quarter commission before the residency. I'm not sure where I would have found the time to design, code, and construct it sooner, but building a new game in 8 weeks consumed all my time and energy.</li>
          <li>I wish I had started the following things sooner:
            <ul>
              <li>office hours</li>
              <li>sitting in on classes</li>
              <li>inviting people to lunch</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I didn't start the three things above until well after the No Quarter show, but they really helped with connection,
            community, and finding my place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If I were staying longer?</h2>
        <p>These are the thing that moved me the most, these are the parts I felt were still unfolding as I had to leave.</p>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-tiny.png" alt="invitation for tiny play experiments" class="wide-image">
        <p class="img-caption">The invitations I made for people to collab with me. I left some with plates of cookies and snacks<p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little experiments / playful interventions:</strong> while working on these experiments I felt plugged in, like I was working in coordination with the living world around me. These include: <em>Emergency Exhibition Care, Dance Closet, Arcade Friend</em> and <em>
            Why Are You Here.</em></li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge / Skill-sharing:</strong> it's an incredible feeling to share learned skills with people in a community. And this work takes time, trust, connection. So I did some, but would have liked to do more.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> my favourite experiments and interventions were collaborative. When I was working with people (faculty, staff, students, outside community) on tiny projects I felt like we were building these
            live wires
            between us, creating the work and the context for the work all at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="../img/blog-images/ny-connect.png" alt="drawing people connecting" class="wide-image">


        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>When I was leaving I held a hangout/meeting to review the residency. I thought it would be useful for me, useful for the people in the space, and useful for residents who come after. Below are few comments from a people who attended.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I loved the questions you sent before the residency. You sent these questions to us asking “what would a successful residency look like?” and these other questions about what we value and need and it shaped the conversation and the
            entire experience. -N</li>

          <li>Everyone here knew of you and about you because of these little special things you did. I loved the interventions for the showcase, <em>Arcade Friend, Tiny Dance Closet</em>,
            the workshops you hosted. The big things were great too, but it was the little things that were most special for me. -D</li>
          <li>You are a model artist in residence. I loved when you came to speak at survival skills, and I LOVED your talk. It would make sense to do the talk earlier, now everyone wants to talk to you even more but you are leaving. -D</li>
          <li>This residency needs to be longer! -C</li>
          <li>You were an ideal artist in residence. <span class="highlightme">I understand what artists in residence can do now in a way I didn’t get before. You've raised the bar on what we are even able to imagine.</span> -F</li>
        </ul>
