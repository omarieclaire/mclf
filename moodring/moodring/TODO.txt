TODO

add choice animation -  "other choice" fades away and your choice is highlighted
add spacer walls between levels (when Robin finished them)
get it working on mobile - images & layout (when Robin finishes the mobile walls TODO - sort this out)
make sure the UX & UI is good on mobile (after item above)
add transitions and animations on all buttons
integrate scroll trigger animations (big project)
  1. Temporarily "lock" a background in place while I scroll in animated elements (unlock when I click a button)
  2. Have an animation that starts animating when I click a button, continues animating when I scroll, and finishes animating when I reach another div.
get it to load much faster (important!)
nicer looking png images for the logos at the end (ask Robin and Rachel for these)
create the "start again" functionality in the code (funct to reset everything?)
check browser compatibility: make it work in chrome, firefox, IE
modify text - updates and tweaks!
build a new custom music player with Robin's new gifs (this might be hard)
integrate custom "last levels" with code (when Robin finishes them)
integrate the clickable gifs (when Robin sends them in) this may also be hard
debug the bug that happens when someone changes their mind
make sure this doesn't conflate light with good

IF TIME
things that follow the cursor?
music player animates - "length of song/where you are in the song"
choose your character
text generation for final screen?
animating waves

QUESTIONS
is it good to have the images in the background?
